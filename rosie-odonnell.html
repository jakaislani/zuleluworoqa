After her role in the 1992 film A League of Their Own, O'Donnell went on to further success on the small screen, notably with her own daytime talk show and later as co-host of The View. An outspoken LGBT activist, O'Donnell has found herself in tabloid headlines for her multiple marriages and personal issues.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Roseann O'Donnell<br>BORN: March 21, 1962<br>BIRTHPLACE: Commack, NY<br>SPOUSE: Michelle Rounds (m. 2012-2015), Kelli Carpenter (m. 2004-2004)<br>CHILDREN: Chelsea Belle O'Donnell, Parker Jaren O'Donnell, Vivienne Rose O'Donnell, Blake Christopher O'Donnell<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aries</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell was born Roseann O'Donnell on March 21, 1962, in Commack, New York. The third of five children, she is the daughter of Roseann and Edward O'Donnell, a homemaker and an electrical engineer, respectively.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Being part of a large family had its challenges. "We weren't poor—my father was an electrical engineer—but there were five children," O'Donnell later said. "The kids who went to school with us in Dix Hills [New York] would all get Camaros on their 16th birthdays. And at our house, we had a Plymouth Volare with an AM radio. All five of us kids had to use that car. We went to the flea market to buy clothes, not Macy's."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Life got harder when Rosie was 10 years old; her mother died of cancer, and her father took the loss particularly hard. Becoming emotionally distanced from the rest of the family, O'Donnell's father coped by removing most of his wife's belongings from the family home. One of the few reminders of their mother that escaped their father's touch was an old record collection. O'Donnell and her siblings often sought comfort by listening to their mother's albums—particularly the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a73695244/barbra-streisand/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barbra Streisand" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barbra Streisand</a> records.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"When we came home from school, [my mother] would put on Barbra Streisand's A Happening in Central Park and cook dinner, and we would sing all the songs to it," she explained to Redbook. "[My father] didn't know about that, because that was a ritual that was done while he was at work. ... So the only thing I had that was hers were the records. My love of Barbra Streisand is totally taken from my mother's sheer and complete adoration of her. She is what my mother left me."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 title="Stand-Up Comedy" data-anchor-id=stand-up-comedy class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Stand-Up Comedy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell's love of music and theater didn't stop with Streisand, and by high school she had officially caught the acting bug. She imitated <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a53299979/gilda-radner/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gilda Radner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gilda Radner</a>'s character "Roseanne Rosannadanna" for a skit, which earned her high praise and helped foster a desire to pursue a career in comedy. By watching and imitating other comics such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jerry-seinfeld data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jerry Seinfeld" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, O'Donnell eventually came up with her own material and honed her magnetic presence for the stage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell was a popular student who was elected prom queen, homecoming queen, most school-spirited and class president before graduation. After matriculating, she embarked on a stand-up comedy tour around the United States, appearing in 49 states over a five-year period. It was a difficult and enlightening time for O'Donnell, who slowly came to grips with the unhealthy lifestyle and sexist climate of the comedy world. She told Robert Hoffler of Buzz, "Everybody was doing drugs and drinking, and I was just this little girl on the road, scared in her room."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After returning home to study briefly at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and Boston University, O'Donnell returned to performing. She made five winning appearances on Star Search before moving to Los Angeles in 1984. She landed a part in the last season of NBC's popular sitcom Gimme a Break before cable music video channel VH1 snatched her up as a VJ. When the station decided to stop using VJs, O'Donnell convinced the company to create Stand-Up Spotlight, a television program that showcased comedians. O'Donnell signed on as the show's host and, for the next four years, helped make Stand-Up Spotlight VH1's most popular show.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 title="Sidekick Roles" data-anchor-id=sidekick-roles class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Sidekick Roles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1992, after appearing in several television specials, O'Donnell made a much-desired move to film. She made her big-screen debut as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://web.archive.org/web/20221226234003/https://www.biography.com/people/madonna-9394994 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Madonna class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Madonna</a>'s loveable sidekick in A League of Their Own, a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/penny-marshall data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Penny Marshall" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Penny Marshall</a>-directed film. During filming, O'Donnell forged many connections and friendships which served to enhance her career, including an enduring relationship with co-star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/madonna data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Madonna class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Madonna</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her role spawned a string of "best friend" parts: playing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a62661388/meg-ryan/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meg Ryan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meg Ryan</a>'s closest pal in 1993's Sleepless in Seattle; co-starring alongside Richard Dreyfuss and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a87150093/emilio-estevez/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emilio Estevez " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Emilio Estevez </a>in Another Stakeout (1993); and making a memorable appearance across from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a90433806/natalie-portman/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Natalie Portman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Natalie Portman</a> and Timothy Hutton as the wise-cracking hairdresser in Beautiful Girls (1996). O'Donnell began a trend of making praiseworthy performances in less-than-extraordinary films.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1994, O'Donnell's dream of performing live on stage materialized when she was cast as Rizzo in Tommy Tune's Broadway revival of Grease! However, both the production and O'Donnell's performance met lukewarm reviews. O'Donnell also expressed concern about the message of the play, with its sexist premise about a girl who must transform herself into a tightly-clad vamp to gain acceptance from her boyfriend and his friends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following her Broadway debut, O'Donnell appeared in Lesli Linka Glatter's coming-of-age film, Now and Then (1995), alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a34311182/demi-moore/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Demi Moore" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Demi Moore</a> and Melanie Griffith. She also made a cameo on the television sitcom Bless This House. In February 1995, after a two-year hiatus, O'Donnell returned briefly to stand-up in order to prepare for an HBO comedy special.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 title="'The Rosie O'Donnell Show'" data-anchor-id=the-rosie-odonnell-show class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">'The Rosie O'Donnell Show'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell landed another big break when she accepted a gig as host of her own variety talk show for NBC, called The Rosie O'Donnell Show, in 1995. Inspired by The Merv Griffin Show, O'Donnell offered viewers a change of pace from the swarm of sensationalist talk shows commanding the airwaves. Warm and approachable, O'Donnell engaged in light-hearted interviews with celebrities and showcased Broadway performances on her program. "Rosie makes you feel good. She's like everybody's sister," actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/john-travolta data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Travolta" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Travolta</a> told Entertainment Weekly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moving to daytime television also made it easier for O'Donnell to continue to work in show business while raising her two adopted children, Parker and Chelsea Belle, in New York—producers even built a deluxe nursery for her children right in the Rockefeller Center studio. The show quickly became one of the most popular in daytime television, and O'Donnell was hailed as the "Queen of Nice" due to her down-to-earth frankness and sense of humor. During her time on her talk show, O'Donnell received two Emmy awards—one for Outstanding Talk Show and another for Outstanding Talk Show Host.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell also continued to make occasional appearances in films as well; playing a nanny in the children's film Harriett the Spy (1996) and a schoolteacher-nun in 1998's Wide Awake. She blossomed in the children's movie arena, playing the voice of Terk, Tarzan's gorilla companion, in Disney's animated production of Tarzan in 1999. Her continual support of Broadway shows, and theater in general, brought renewed attention to the stage, and the annual Tony Awards show enjoyed some of its highest ratings in years when she hosted.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 title="Coming Out" data-anchor-id=coming-out class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Coming Out</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In November 2000, O'Donnell revealed plans to leave her talk show after her contract expiration in 2002. She told audiences that she hoped to focus more time on her nonprofit organization, which helped facilitate the process of adoption between birth mothers and adoptive families. She then made headlines for her personal life in early 2002, with word that she would officially come out as a lesbian in her autobiography Find Me. Part of her decision to come out was fueled by a desire to advocate on behalf of gay adoption.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell and her partner, Kelli Carpenter, had taken in a foster child from Florida whom they wished to adopt. Florida law, however, prohibited homosexuals from adopting. The American Civil Liberties Union was waging a legal battle against the law, and O'Donnell felt that she could help. "When I read about this lawsuit, when we had the experience of being discriminated against with our foster child, that's when God tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'You're in, Kid,'" she told The Advocate. O'Donnell and her partner were unable to adopt their foster child, but they did add to their family later that year: In November, Carpenter gave birth to a baby girl, Vivienne Rose.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also in 2002, O'Donnell announced that she would no longer produce her namesake magazine after a little over a year on newsstands. Though the magazine was fairly well-received, O'Donnell cited editorial differences for the reason she pulled the plug, causing O'Donnell's publisher to file a $100 million lawsuit for breach of contract. O'Donnell later filed a $125 million countersuit, claiming the publishers seized control and forced her out. In the midst of the media-heavy trial that ensued, she continued to produce her Broadway musical, Taboo, about the life of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/british-people/a86650638/boy-george/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Boy George" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Boy George</a>. However, after receiving negative reviews and publicity, the show closed just three months after it opened.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2004, O'Donnell wed longtime partner Kelli Carpenter in San Francisco, California. Carpenter changed her last name to O'Donnell, but their union was later annulled by a California court decision. The couple also enjoyed the first cruise organized by their travel business R Family Vacations, which creates holidays for gays, lesbians and their friends and families. The voyage was featured in a documentary shown on HBO.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 title="Return to Television" data-anchor-id=return-to-television class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Return to Television</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell returned to the daytime talk show format in 2006 when she signed on to become co-host and moderator of the ABC's The View, replacing Meredith Vieira. Her time on the show, which also featured <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/barbara-walters data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barbara Walters" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barbara Walters</a>, Joy Behar and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, brought strong ratings along with some controversy. She and the conservative Hasselbeck often clashed during group discussions on the show. In April 2007, following a particularly heated exchange with Hasselbeck, O'Donnell announced that she was leaving the show a few weeks before the expiration of her contract. Later that same year, she published her second memoir, Celebrity Detox, which detailed her struggle with fame and her time at The View.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2008, O'Donnell tried to revive the variety show format on prime-time television with her Rosie Live! special. The show received low ratings despite an impressive array of guests, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a46829581/alec-baldwin/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alec Baldwin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alec Baldwin</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a70475791/liza-minnelli/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Liza Minnelli" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Liza Minnelli</a>. After taking some time away from the spotlight, O'Donnell premiered her new two-hour daily talk show, Rosie Radio, on Sirius XM Satellite Radio in 2009. O'Donnell then returned to television with her own show on Oprah Winfrey's network, OWN, which debuted in January 2011. Unfortunately, the show failed to develop a large enough audience to stay on the air.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the summer of 2014, it was announced that O'Donnell would be returning as co-host of The View for its 18th season, slated to join <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/whoopi-goldberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Whoopi Goldberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Whoopi Goldberg</a> after the departures of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jenny-mccarthy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jenny McCarthy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jenny McCarthy</a>, Sherri Shepherd and Walters. However, O'Donnell's return was short-lived, as she made her final appearance on the show in February 2015.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 title="Love and Marriages" data-anchor-id=love-and-marriages class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Love and Marriages</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell revealed in late 2009 that her relationship with Kelli had come to an end. They had separated two years earlier but remained on good terms. "What makes a family is love, and we all love each other. We're gonna stay together and take care of each other as a family unit," she explained to People magazine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The next year, O'Donnell revealed that she was dating Texas-based artist Tracy Kachtick-Anders, a mother of six children. "I'm pretty content. I feel calmer than I have in a long time," she told People magazine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The two split in 2011, but O'Donnell didn't remain single for long. She started dating business consultant Michelle Rounds that same year. The pair married in June 2012, shortly before Rounds underwent surgery to remove desmoid tumors, and the following January they adopted a baby girl, Dakota. However, in February 2015 O'Donnell filed for divorce on the grounds of an "irretrievably broken relationship." She experienced more personal turmoil later that year, when her teenage daughter Chelsea went missing for a few days before surfacing in the home of a 25-year-old man.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 2018, O'Donnell announced her engagement to her girlfriend, Elizabeth Rooney.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 title="Health and Politics" data-anchor-id=health-and-politics class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Health and Politics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O'Donnell suffered a heart attack in August 2012.
