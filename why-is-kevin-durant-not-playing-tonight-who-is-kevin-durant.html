This implies that he will not play in the basketball game against the Memphis Grizzlies. This season, Durant has been a vital member of the Suns’ squad, putting up big scores and assisting in their victories.</p><p>But occasionally, athletes with mild ailments must take a vacation to ensure complete recovery and prevent exacerbation of the injury.</p><p>Hence, Kevin Durant will not be available for tonight’s game, and Nassir Little and Keita Bates-Diop will have to step up and assume greater responsibilities in his place. Supporters anticipate that Durant will return soon to carry on helping the team win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Kevin Durant?</h2><p>The Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA) now have talented and well-known basketball star Kevin Durant on their roster. Durant, who was born on September 29, 1988, has had a remarkable career and left a lasting impression on the clubs he has played for.</p><p>After starting his career with the Seattle SuperSonics in 2007, he eventually joined the Golden State Warriors, where he won two NBA titles in a row and was named the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals MVP.</p><p>Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year after playing basketball for two years at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy. He grew five inches (13 cm) before the season began, starting at six feet seven inches (2.01 meters).</p><p>He committed to the University of Texas at Austin before the season began. He claimed to have looked at Duke University, University of Kentucky, and University of Louisville. He had visited the Universities of Connecticut and North Carolina. In response to the question of why he picked a college with a less well-known program, he stated, “Wanted to set my own path.”</p><p>He was named the 2006 McDonald’s All-American Game Most Valuable Player and the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year at the end of the season. Behind Greg Oden, he was considered by many to be the second-best high school prospect of 2006.</p><p>Had the NBA not implemented the one-and-done rule which awarded the first overall pick to his childhood favorite, the Toronto Raptors Duran said he would have filed for the 2006 NBA draft.</p><p>On the basketball court, Durant is renowned for his scoring abilities, flexibility, and general greatness. His recent signing with the Phoenix Suns in 2023 has strengthened the team’s squad and elevated them to the status of a serious Western Conference rival. Even though Durant’s foot injury caused a little delay, he is still a key player in the Suns’ quest for victory in the current NBA season.</p><p>Durant was considered the second-best player in his class and a highly recruited high school prospect. He became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year and won multiple year-end awards while in college.</p><p>In his professional career, he has been selected for 13 NBA All-Star teams, ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, two NBA championships, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and four NBA scoring titles. Durant was selected for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.</p><p>In addition to his three gold medals from the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020), Durant is the all-time leading scorer in Team USA’s men’s Olympic basketball history. He also took home the gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Off the court, Durant is among the highest paid basketball players in the world, partly because of endorsement deals with companies like Nike and Foot Locker.</p><p>In addition to consistently leading the league in jersey sales and All-Star votes, he has earned a reputation for being a generous man. He has been a writer and photographer for The Players’ Tribune in recent years. He made his acting debut in the movie Thunderstruck in 2012.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is Kevin Durant Not Playing Tonight – FAQs</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is Kevin Durant not playing tonight for the Phoenix Suns?</h2><p>Kevin Durant is not playing tonight because he has a sore right foot, and the team wants to ensure he can fully recover from this minor injury.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How has Durant contributed to the Suns this season?</h2><p>Durant has been a key player, scoring many points and helping the Suns win games with his skills and versatility on the basketball court.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What do players like Keita Bates-Diop and Nassir Little need to do in Durant’s absence?</h2><p>In Durant’s absence, other players like Keita Bates-Diop and Nassir Little will need to step up, take on more responsibility, and contribute to the team’s performance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When did Durant join the Phoenix Suns?</h2><p>Durant joined the Phoenix Suns in 2023, bringing his talent and experience to strengthen the team’s roster.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What championships did Durant win with the Golden State Warriors?</h2><p>Durant won consecutive NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfsmWZqHqssdWipWacpaeur8CMp6atZaChrrq1zaBkraeenrSpwIywn6hlmah6rLHVoqVmnKWnrq%2FAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-kevin-durant-not-playing-tonight-who-is-kevin-durant.html&text=Why%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%20Not%20Playing%20Tonight%3f%20Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-kevin-durant-not-playing-tonight-who-is-kevin-durant.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-kevin-durant-not-playing-tonight-who-is-kevin-durant.html&title=Why%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%20Not%20Playing%20Tonight%3f%20Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-is-kevin-durant-not-playing-tonight-who-is-kevin-durant.html&title=Why%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%20Not%20Playing%20Tonight%3f%20Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-kevin-durant-not-playing-tonight-who-is-kevin-durant.html&title=Why%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%20Not%20Playing%20Tonight%3f%20Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-kevin-durant-not-playing-tonight-who-is-kevin-durant.html&description=Why%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%20Not%20Playing%20Tonight%3f%20Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./aidan-miner-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aidan Miner - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sandy-hendrickse-net-worth-income-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandy Hendrickse Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
