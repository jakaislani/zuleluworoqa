The average engineer salary in Silicon Valley by years of experience: Less than 1 year — $109,622.</span></span><h2>Is 120k a good salary in Silicon Valley?</h2>An annual salary of $120,000 would sound like a pretty good deal anywhere around the world. But that may not always be the case in Silicon Valley, where soaring rent prices and its brutal cost of living make $120,000 look almost average — even though it's more than double the US median household income.<h2>What is a good Bay Area salary?</h2>A good salary in San Francisco, CA is anything over $75,000. That's because the median income in San Francisco is $75,000, which means if you earn more than that you're earning more than 50% of the people living in San Francisco.

While $350,000 might sound like a lot of money, it'll go quickly when you're raising a family in an expensive city.<h2>Price Comparison: Highest Paid Jobs</h2><p></p><h2>Is 500k middle class?</h2>With the median U.S. income being about $80,000 a year, a household of four earning between roughly $52,000 and $175,000 a year is considered middle class.<h2>What is considered a good salary in tech?</h2>Overall, the global average salary for tech workers in major cities is $135,000.

I would say 125k maybe the low, maybe mostly low skilled H1b workers. But including bonus, 5 years plus experience, 200k is very much possible. 150-175k is possible for someone in devops with 3-4 years experience in most large cities in USA.<h2>Is 100K a year good in California?</h2>The folks at the personal finance site GoBankingRates.com looked at where a $100K income would be considered "good" in America's 50 largest cities. Eight of the cities are in California, and it likely comes as no shock to those who live in the Golden State that $100,000 doesn't go too far.<h2>Is 124k a good salary?</h2>124k is decent. It puts you solidly in the middle class for SoCal. However, I currently make considerably more. While I can certainly live well on 124k and I'm old enough and have accumulated enough that taking a payout would not hurt me, it would not cover my current cash flows.<h2>Is $120 000 a good salary?</h2>The median income for the US was $67,512 in 2020. This means that a salary of $120,000 is around double the US median household income, and it is almost four times the average single person income – only very high earners earn significantly above this.<h2>What can you afford with 120k salary?</h2>So start by doing the math. If you make $50,000 a year, your total yearly housing costs should ideally be no more than $14,000, or $1,167 a month. If you make $120,000 a year, you can go up to $33,600 a year, or $2,800 a month—as long as your other debts don't push you beyond the 36 percent mark.<h2>Is working at Silicon Valley worth it?</h2>You'll Make Good Money<p>The average starting salary for a software engineer in Silicon Valley is $111,000, and it only goes up from there.

The median household income in San Jose is $104,675 – the second-highest amount for this rate in the whole study, but still not enough to avoid being housing cost-burdened.</p><h2>What salary is upper class?</h2>An upper class income is usually considered at least 50% higher than the median household income. Therefore, an upper class income in America is $100,000 and higher. However, an upper class income also depends on where you live.<h2>Is 250k household income good?</h2>By most measures, a $250,000 household income is substantial.
