And, of course, we were especially moved by the ever-evolving relationship between Chuck and Blair. Readers, we’ll confess to you and only you: When Chuck at last succumbed to Blair’s cuddle, tears streaking down his odd funny-shaped face, we were&nbsp;so&nbsp;moved that before we knew it we were misting up a little, and there was snot, and we had to get off the treadmill and hobble out of the gym to watch the rest of the show in the privacy of our own homes. Not that it helped much. Everyone at the gym knew what we were sobbing about; they were watching it on their little screens,&nbsp;too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzepc000023d5u45q2mmpv@published data-word-count=52>But after we got home, we entered the angry stage, because everything seemed to be falling apart.

Surely he would have gone for a nice aged Scotch.&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;2</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeqwr00143d5ue64gyk4l@published data-word-count=39>• After the high-school experiences we are led to believe they’ve had (and just having been friends with the infamous Old Serena), Blair and Nate would be better at controlling drunk people. Everyone knows Step One is “piggyback rides.”&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;2</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeqy100153d5uucabg80f@published data-word-count=85>• So, timing in this episode is all messed up. Lily and Rufus make plans to go away to a B&B together&nbsp;the night after the funeral? If Bart Bass’s death is big enough to “rock the city,” then “Page Six” would be all over that, and Lily — even the new, openly Rufus-obsessed Lily — is way too image-conscious to allow that. Also, Aaron’s invitation to take Serena to Argentina is effective&nbsp;immediately? That was super convenient of Bart, to die over Christmas vacation like that.&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;3</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeqzw00173d5uuiglc7je@published data-word-count=65>• We’re confused. We’re told Bart Bass died in a car accident on the way to meet Lily, but when last we saw him, he was in the car on the way to meet Lily, with private detective Andrew Tyler. Did he switch cars? How did Andrew Tyler get away without a scratch?&nbsp;<strong>Minus 20</strong>, because we should have some exposition other than “there was an&nbsp;accident.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzerat001g3d5uxnoeanbi@published data-word-count=93>• “I was thinking something in a jacket, very&nbsp;YSL,” Eleanor suggests for her wedding outfit. “Mick and Bianca, 1971, great reference,” Jenny comes up and says in the most patronizing way possible, especially since Bianca Jagger’s wedding blazer showed enormous, unsupported cleavage and Eleanor clearly wants to wear one because she’s old and saggy and doesn’t want to show her shoulders.&nbsp;<strong>Minus 4</strong>&nbsp;because Eleanor would have remembered all too well how Jenny screwed her by running off with her marquee dress. And also&nbsp;<strong>Minus 4</strong>&nbsp;because Jenny, ugh, put some bottoms on, you’re at a funeral&nbsp;reception.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer2u00183d5ui0vovzrz@published data-word-count=32>• “If you’re looking for Bart’s will, you don’t have to worry,” Lilly says. What does that mean, exactly? Don’t leave us hanging when there are monetary figures starting with “B” involved!&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;1</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer4a001a3d5uz3bcfqdi@published data-word-count=35>• “The only reason he got in that car is because you called him,” Lily says to Chuck.&nbsp;<strong>Minus 3</strong>, because even the worst parent would know that is the one thing you don’t get to&nbsp;say.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer4u001b3d5ufe3tlo9b@published data-word-count=12>• • Would the sketchy&nbsp;P.I.&nbsp;really have walked away from Chuck without payment?&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;3</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer7n001c3d5u5ma0vjg6@published data-word-count=20>• Eleanor’s blazer that Jenny made is heinous. Surely she’d have a lovely Chanel somewhere in her closet as backup.&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;1</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer7w001d3d5u7ru3iq2m@published data-word-count=19>• Dan comes home and Rufus is sitting quietly in the dark.&nbsp;<strong>Minus 1</strong>, because nobody does that in real&nbsp;life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer93001e3d5uwqu8ktap@published data-word-count=20>• Why are Lily and Rufus taking a train upstate anyway? Like Lily would ever choose that over a car.&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;2</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer9l001f3d5uzyyaxpkj@published data-word-count=2>Total: 52</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzet7i001h3d5u6bcqua6g@published data-word-count=46>So this episode fell clearly into the more realistic, awesome category than the reverse. We are still troubled by many details, but it was really the conversations about love (“I want you to tell me how I should feel about you!”) that made it pass muster.&nbsp;XOXO.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Gossip Girl Recap: O Brother, Where Bart Thou?</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyou9KsoKlll56%2FrXnRnpqaqF2osqK%2Fzqdka2WVpba0u8OeZGprXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgossip-girl-recap-season-2-episode-13-html.html&text=Gossip%20Girl%20Recap%3a%20O%20Brother%2c%20Where%20Bart%20Thou%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgossip-girl-recap-season-2-episode-13-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgossip-girl-recap-season-2-episode-13-html.html&title=Gossip%20Girl%20Recap%3a%20O%20Brother%2c%20Where%20Bart%20Thou%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgossip-girl-recap-season-2-episode-13-html.html&title=Gossip%20Girl%20Recap%3a%20O%20Brother%2c%20Where%20Bart%20Thou%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgossip-girl-recap-season-2-episode-13-html.html&title=Gossip%20Girl%20Recap%3a%20O%20Brother%2c%20Where%20Bart%20Thou%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgossip-girl-recap-season-2-episode-13-html.html&description=Gossip%20Girl%20Recap%3a%20O%20Brother%2c%20Where%20Bart%20Thou%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./patsy-kensit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patsy Kensit">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elissa-patel-waverly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elissa Patel Waverly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
