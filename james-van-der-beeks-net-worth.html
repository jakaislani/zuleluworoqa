James instantly turned the 3,000-square-foot house into an investment property, leasing it out for $5,000 per month.</p><p>He sold the home in 2014 for $1.15 million, a tiny loss on his initial investment, after getting a lot of rental revenue from it.</p><h4>Beverly Hills Home</h4><p>James Van Der Beek has moved on from Los Angeles. In September, the actor and his wife, Kimberly, revealed that their family relocated to Texas from Beverly Hills, California.</p><p>Their extended family has relocated to a 36-acre ranch outside of Austin. Their voyage to Spicewood, Texas, was documented through Instagram videos and photos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/van-der-beautiful-house.jpg><p>They have the main house, a pool, several cabins, and a backyard with views of the Pedernales River on their wooded property.</p><p>The Van Der Beeks are leasing a 5,149-square-foot property with five bedrooms and three bathrooms. According to an old listing, the beachfront home, which isn’t on the market right now, is a great spot to “channel your ‘hippie cowboy,'” an old listing.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Getting your first ever brand new car as a teenager is a normal rite of passage. And when James Van Der Beek was 17, his car was in such bad shape.</p><p>“I bought a 1986 candy-apple-red Hyundai Excel for $800 with the money I had made doing theater,” the former “<strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dawson’s Creek</a></strong>” actor recounts on this week’s show of “<strong>When I Was 17</strong>,”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/van-der-cars.jpg><p>It also featured “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Jersey Shore</strong></a>” star Snooki and N.E.R.D. Vocalist Pharrell Williams. The car had “a lot of miles on it,” according to Van Der Beek.</p><p>Van Der Beek wasn’t winning any points with the women in the beat-up automobile. He joked, “The automobile was just a prophylactic on wheels.”</p><h2>James Van Der Beek: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>James Van Der Beek played Dawson Leery on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Dawson’s Creek</strong></a> for a generation, and it’s safe to say the legendary ’90s television character made the actor recognized worldwide.</p><p>Van Der Beek has worked steadily since his breakout performance in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Varsity Blues</strong></a>, but he leads a relatively relaxed lifestyle when he’s not acting.</p><p>The actor, who has a lovely wife and a huge family, appears to prefer spending time with his loved ones at home or on the road over walking red carpets and attending expensive events.</p><h4>Cool Father</h4><p>James Van Der Beek is ecstatic that his five children still believe he’s cool, even though he’s a total loving father. Raising children as a renowned actor, the Pose star told Fatherly, has been “interesting.”</p><p>He went on to say that his children are used to people asking for pictures and that “we try not to make a big deal out of it.” For the time being, perhaps? “They seem unconcerned about it,” he observed.</p><p>“They’re still little enough that anything I do seems cool to them. So I’m simply going to enjoy it while it lasts.”</p><p>However, the actor appears to be aware that his children would not always think he is “cool.”</p><h4>Work out</h4><p>On Wednesday, James Van Der Beek published a before-and-after photo demonstrating how dramatically dancing had changed his body.</p><p>The 86-the year-old actor was a contestant on “<strong>Dancing With the Stars</strong>,” but he departed the show two weeks ago after coming fifth.</p><p>And the adjustment in his fitness program had a noticeable impact on his appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/van-der-workout-1024x768.jpg><p>Van Der Beek revealed in the Instagram caption that his previous workout routine consisted of three days of Muay Thai three times a week, which he had been practicing for six months when he snapped the first selfie.</p><h4>Simplicity</h4><p>While many celebrities appear to enjoy the lavish lifestyles that celebrity brings them, James Van Der Beek appears to be content with a quiet existence at home and the occasional trip to a restaurant.</p><p>In fact, the actor claims that the thing he would miss most if he weren’t famous is actually rather understandable.</p><p>Van Der Beek admitted in an interview with iNews, “I’m not sure what I’d do if I went to a crowded restaurant and approached the hostess and didn’t think there was a high chance I’d still be able to obtain a table. That is my special ability. If that superpower were taken away from me, I’d be devastated.”</p><p>Aside from appreciating getting a table at any restaurant, the CSI: Cyber actress gave some advice to today’s youthful stars, such as the Stranger Things kids. “You don’t change overnight,” he explained to iNews, “but how people treat you changes.”</p><p>Because of anything that is fundamentally fictitious.” Van Der Beek appears to have his feet firmly planted on the ground and is unfazed by the so-called celebrity lifestyle.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>When the Van Der Beeks decided to relocate from Los Angeles to Texas, they took a road trip. Rather than hiring a moving company, the family rented an RV and set out on a cross-country road trip, chronicling their experiences along the way.</p><p>James Van Der Beek added, “I shared some nice images from the voyage on Instagram.”</p><p>“A ten-day road trip There are five children. There are two dogs. We also got two young rescue puppies on the first day. Because it isn’t an adventure unless your excellent friends try to convince you out of at least some part of your vacation.”</p><p>James Van Der Beek recalls one of his memorable family vacations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/van-der-vacation-1024x1021.jpg><p>With all five of their children in tow, the Pose star and his wife Kimberly Van Der Beek made a road trip to Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada near the end of 2018!</p><p>Their children — son Joshua, 6, and girls Olivia, 8, Annabel, 4, Emilia, 2, and Gwendolyn, 7 months — had a great time exploring the canyons and eating salads in an RV during their trip.</p><p>James, 41, uploaded a series of images from his vacation a week after returning to Los Angeles, including a sweet full-family shot and photos of the youngsters soaking in the sights.</p><h2>Stage Career, Movies, and TV Shows, Book Publications</h2><h3>Stage Career</h3><p>Van Der Beek began his professional debut at 16 in an off-Broadway play called “Finding the Sun.”</p><p>After dropping out of university, Van Der Beek won a role in “<strong>My Marriage to Ernest Borgnine</strong>” at New York’s Vineyard Theater. He performed many auditions for tv shows and movies while acting on stage.</p><p>Van Der Beek did not return to the stage until 2003 when he played a minor role in the off-Broadway production of “<strong>Rain Dance</strong>.”</p><h3>Movies and TV Shows</h3><p>One thing is certain: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Dawson’s Creek</strong></a> is the project for which he is most well-known. As a result, that’s probably the best place to start.</p><p>The show debuted on WB and lasted six seasons, with the final episode airing on May 14, 2003. Even though <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Dawson’s Creek</strong></a> aired from 1998 to 2003, James Van Der Beek did not profit until 2012.</p><p>Throughout all of the seasons, he testified that he was paid next to nothing. This was due to a lousy contract and a general lack of experience in the entertainment industry.</p><p>It’s quite tough to say how much money the actor made from his other series. Nonetheless, they have undoubtedly boosted James Van Der Beek’s net worth. Over the years, he has made an appearance in a large variety of productions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/van-der-movie.png><p>He went on to play Sean Bateman in the film adaption of the novel <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Rules of Attraction</strong></a> in 2002. The picture garnered mixed reviews; while it bombed at the box office, it followed a devoted DVD.</p><p>In 2006, he starred in the Direct-to-DVD thriller <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>The Plague</strong></a>. The critics were also harsh on this film.</p><p>His role in the iconic TV show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>How I Met Your Mother</strong></a> was another memorable performance that undoubtedly earned some cash. He played the character, Simon, in the show’s ninth season.</p><p>That episode aired on November 25, 2013, and it unquestionably improved his notoriety as well as his net worth.</p><h3>Book Publication</h3><p>As per the research, James Van Der Beek has not written any book so far. Therefore, it is yet to be written.</p><h2>Divorce Financial</h2><p>James Van Der Beek wedded Heather McComb in 2003.&nbsp;The divorce papers surfaced in 2010, revealing that Van Der Beek was making around $50,000 per month at the time.
