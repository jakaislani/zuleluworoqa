He was born on 17th April 2009. The boy came 12 days late; he was expected to be born on 5th April but chose to arrive early Friday morning on the 17th. His place of birth is Nashville, Tennessee, which makes him a citizen of the United States, but his ethnicity is White.</p><p>His celebrity parents, Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Brad Paisley, named their bundle of joy after his paternal great grandfather, Warren Jarvis Paisley. Thanks to Warren Jarvis, Brad got his first guitar which aided the then-upcoming music star to launch his career.</p><p>Jasper is not the only child of Kim and Brad; the youngster has a big brother who goes by the name of Williams Huckleberry Paisley. Huck, as he is fondly called, is a couple of years older than Jasper and is a high school student. The two Paisley children spend their formative years in a log house in Franklin, Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>Absolutely nothing has been said about Jasper Warren Paisley’s academic pursuits. Still, from what is perceivable, he is in the process of completing his primary education and is expected to join high school come 2023.</p><h3><strong>Who is Jasper’s Dad?</strong></h3><p>Jasper Warren Paisley’s father has been identified as the superstar country singer, songwriter, and author, Brad Douglas Paisley. Born in Glen Dale, West Virginia, on 28th October 1972, Brad is the son of a class teacher, Sandra Jean’ Sandy’ and an employee of the West Virginia Department of Transportation, Douglas Edward ‘Doug’ Paisley.</p><p>Despite his humble beginnings, Brad grew to become one of the best country musicians in the world with a total of 11 studio albums, and what’s more, all are certified Gold by the RIAA.</p><h3><strong>Kimberly Williams-Paisley is the Name of Jasper Warren Paisley’s Mom&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Jasper Warren Paisley’s mom, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, is originally a New Yorker born in Rye, NY, on 14th February 1971. While her mother, Linda Barbara, was a philanthropist, Kim’s dad, Gurney Williams III, worked and earned a living as a science writer. She has a brother called Jay Williams and one sister, Ashley Williams; Ashley is also into acting.</p><p>Kim is part of the entertainment industry in her capacity as an actress, producer, cum director. She gained fame as part of the cast of Father of the Bride and has recorded appearances in more than 50 productions on both the big and small screen.</p><h2><strong>Jasper’s Parents Were Married for Six Years Before He Was Born</strong></h2><p>After their 2003 wedding, Brad Paisley and his wife, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, started having kids four years later. The celebrity power couple’s union was still going strong in 2009 when they had their second son Jasper after his big brother, Huck, came in 2007.</p><p>Kim and Brad have distinguished themselves from the present-day celeb couple whose marriages never last. The couple has lived together as man and wife for almost two decades which is quite commendable and worthy of emulation. They currently serve couples’ goals in both the music and movie industries and are a good example for the younger generation.</p><h3><strong>Jasper Was Already a Huge Source of Joy To His Parents Before His Arrival</strong></h3><p>According to the great country musician Brad Paisley, his joy knew no bound one fateful morning when his then 20-month-old first son, Huck, who usually wakes up to read him a story, brought a pregnancy test result instead.</p><p>Immediately Brad was able to decode the content of the paper, and the music superstar said he was overjoyed. His mind was already thinking about Huck as a big brother who would learn how to share things with his younger one.</p><p>The couple officially announced they are expecting another child in October 2008; Brad and Kim narrated how enjoyable family life has been with Huck and are expecting the new addition to increase their happiness. Brad couldn’t hold his excitement when they attended the 42nd CMA Awards, where he couldn’t resist stooping down to kiss Kim’s baby bump.</p><h2><strong>Is Jasper Warren Paisley Likely to Follow in his Parents’ Footsteps?</strong></h2><p>Jasper Warren Paisley is just 14, but fans are already expecting the young man to indicate interest in either the music industry or the movie world. However, Brad Paisley doesn’t appear ready for a career yet. The youngster enjoys his childhood, but that does not rule out that he may harbor some creative genes in either direction.</p><p>With that said, we must acknowledge that Kim and Brad are quite overly protective of their children, making it impossible for the media or the general public to get wind of what is currently happening in their lives.</p><h2><strong>Brad Paisley’s Son, Jasper Warren Paisley, is Passionate About Animals</strong></h2><p>According to reports, Brad Paisley’s second son, Jasper Warren Paisley, is an animal lover. The youngster is passionate about animals and is said to harbor a soft spot for strays and hopeless creatures. Their two dogs, Hoot and Annie, were adopted from animal rescue homes, and they also have a family donkey to play with.</p><p>Being surrounded by animals at home doesn’t appear enough for Jasper, who loves to visit the zoo regularly. On one of his birthday celebrations, Kim shared a cute image of Jasper with gorillas at the zoo, tagging the young man, “The-philosopher-in-the-making.”</p><p>Jasper once told his big brother, Huck, that he would prefer being the ball in the air rather than the bat that smashes the ball. Kim appreciates that her little man appears to have a mature mind at such a tender age.</p><h2><strong>Key Facts About Jasper Warren Paisley, Brad Paisley’s Son</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Who is Jasper Warren Paisley?</strong> Jasper Warren Paisley is the second and youngest child of American actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley and country music superstar Brad Paisley.
